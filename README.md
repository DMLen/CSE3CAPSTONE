# CSE3CAP
This repo includes the software components for our CSE3CAP Capstone project. We are creating a smart solar power system relying on OpenHab, consumer power meters and smart appliance plugs

This software allows us to remotely control TAPO P110 smart plugs, to turn devices on and off based on the (simulated) electrical production of solar panels.

No, the code isn't my finest. But this is what I did with my group for our capstone project. Credits to all members of our team Mayank, Alan, Alex, and Grace for contributing in various ways.

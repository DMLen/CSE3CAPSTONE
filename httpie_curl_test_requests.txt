//load devices from json
//note: this overrides current devices, so do this asap. multithreading is janky so apparently this is needed. it is some esoteric code voodoo nonsense i dont have the spirit to properly fix. so have this stupid hack instead.

//update device named Toaster
//
// Usage: All update requests must include devicename as the name of the device to be edited.
//        Any other values, if supplied, will overwrite those of the device object in the list.
//        Any excluded values will be left as is. The below example will overwrite all possible values.
